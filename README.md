# Krishi Sahayak - AgriTech Project
### Web app to detect pests in crops and provide appropriate remedies based on it.
* We use a publicly available and quite famous, the PlantVillage Dataset. The dataset was published by crowdAI during the "PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge". The dataset consists of about 54,305
images of plant leaves collected under controlled environmental conditions.
* Using Image Processing and Machine Learning to detect the plant disease based on the photos taken by farmer. We used Python Libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow to make this.
* The website also includes an E-commerce page which can be used to sell Pesticides. The business aspect of this project is to tie up with local fertilizer and pesticides seller and show their products on our page for sale.
* I used ReactJS to make this website and made the backend using Flask which was used to deploy the Machine learning model.
